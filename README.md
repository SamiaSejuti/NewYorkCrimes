# NewYorkCrimes
The website examines the frequency of crimes that occur in New York. It shows different charts that have been made to display the statistics of the crimes from 2013 to 2018. It is built entirely using D3.js. No other templates or libraries have been used. The website is still a work in progress and is not responsive and the elements can be seen all over the place. 
Please set the zoom at 75% to get the best outcomes.
